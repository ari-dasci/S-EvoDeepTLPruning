# S-EvoDeepTLPruning

This is the official repository of EvoDeepTLPruning: Evolutionary Algorithm for Deep Transfer Learning by Pruning Neurons in Dense Layers

## Code

The implementation of EvoDeepTLPruning is divided in the following folders:

   * EvoDeepTLPruning FC1 FC2: the folder contains the python files for the one layer approaches.
   * EvoDeepTLPruning Both: this folders contains the python files for the both layer approach.
   * CNN pruning methods: contains the implementation of the compared CNN pruning methods in the paper.
   * configs: contains the configuration files for each analyzed dataset in the paper.
   * convergence images: it contains the images for the convergence of some used datasets.
